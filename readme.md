# Instructions

1. Clone your repository to your local machine.
2. Write code for all the functions in week1.py
3. Run the tests by running `python -m unittest test_week1.py` in the terminal.
4. Write your own tests in test_week1.py to test your code further. My grading will include additional tests.
5. Whenever you want, commit your code and push it to GitHub. Your last commit will be graded.
6. Check the Actions tab in your repository to see if the tests passed. If they didn't, you can click on the tests to see what you failed. This includes hidden tests that are not part of the test_week1.py file.
